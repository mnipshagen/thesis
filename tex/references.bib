abstract = {This paper explores the socio-demographic variables (age, gender, ethnicity,

education, work status, and disability) and study environment (course programme and course

block), that may influence persistence or dropout of the distance education students at the

Open Polytechnic. It examines to what extent these factors, i.e. enrolment data help us in preidentifying

successful and unsuccessful students.

The data stored in the Open Polytechnic student management system from 2006 to

2009, covering over 450 students who enrolled to Information Systems course was used to

perform a quantitative analysis of study outcome. Based on a data mining techniques (such as

feature selection and classification trees) and logistic regression the most important factors

for student success and a profile of the typical successful and unsuccessful students are

identified.

The empirical results show the following: (i) the most important factors separating

successful from unsuccessful students are: ethnicity, course programme and course block; (ii)

among classification tree growing methods Classification and Regression Tree (CART) was

the most successful in growing the tree with an overall percentage of correct classification of

60.5{\%}; (iii) both the risk estimated by the cross-validation and the gain diagram suggests that

all trees, based only on enrolment data, are not quite good in separating successful from

unsuccessful students, and (iv) the same conclusion was reached using the logistic regression.

The implications of these results for academic and administrative staff are discussed.},

    journaltitle = {International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education},
    language = {English},
    abstract = {An e-learning discussion forum, an essential component of today's e-learning systems, offers a platform for social learning activities. However, as learners participate in the discussion forum, privacy emerges as a major concern. Privacy concerns in social learning activities originate from one learner's inability to convey a desired presentation of oneself to another learner. A user-controlled identity management (IM) allows a user to communicate, depending on a context, as much or as little information about the self as they want, and therefore, can provide users desired control over their contextual representations, which in turn contributes to privacy. A role- and relationship-based identity management (RRIM) model provides a coarse-to-fine classification of context based on purpose, role, and relationship. At the coarse level of context, a purpose-based identity allows presentation of oneself for a specific purpose. At the fine level of context, a role-based identity can facilitate presentation of oneself within the capacity of a role, while a relationship-based identity allows a user to reveal or conceal information appropriate for a relationship. We employ the model in a real e-learning system (i.e., iHelp) to facilitate privacy for e-learners in a discussion forum. The results of a pilot study and a large-scale user study in a real course (i.e., Introduction to Sociology) validate that RRIM features help learners maintain their desired level of privacy in an e-learning discussion forum.

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

    abstract = {Thesupport-vector network is a new learning machine for two-group classification problems. The machine conceptually implements the following idea: input vectors are non-linearly mapped to a very high-dimension feature space. In this feature space a linear decision surface is constructed. Special properties of the decision surface ensures high generalization ability of the learning machine. The idea behind the support-vector network was previously implemented for the restricted case where the training data can be separated without errors. We here extend this result to non-separable training data.},
